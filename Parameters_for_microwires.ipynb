    "#### Notes\n",
    "* _The dose may vary in a range of approx. 5 mJ_\n",
    "* f=0.1 SUPER q. takes approx. 64 minutes to write (the time depends on f linearly)\n",
    "* f=0.1 NORMAL q. takes approx. 27 minutes to write\n",
    "\n",
    "* SUPER q. fine and straight sidewalls, but also 10 periodicity\n",
    "* NORMAL q. rough sidewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "* long exposure time\n",
    "* samples are very sensitive on the surface imperfections (e. g. waves in glass)\n",
    "* 10px periodicity\n",

    "#### Notes\n",
    "* SUPER quality is useless because of major 10px periodicity, the change in width could be more than 100 nm\n",
    "* The dose may vary\n",
    "* f=0.1 NORMAL q. takes approx. 17 minutes to write\n",

    "#### Advantages\n",
    "* much shorter exposure time\n",
    "* less sensitive on the surface imperfections - more stable results\n"
